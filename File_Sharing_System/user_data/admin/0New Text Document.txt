Coursera - Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
(it is a bit outdated, but useful for the basics)
Coursera - Deep Learning by deeplearning.ai
(now this is a good jump towards ML\DL)
Udacity - ML courses(you can search for it, 
I forgot the actual name)
for the better understandings on mathematics as 
it is much needed in DL:
Coursera - Mathematics behind Machine Learning by 
Imperial College London 

along with this courses follow some you tube videos 
or you can also follow some blog where they used CNN, 
RCNN, RNN via Tensorflow or Pytorch, this will lead you 
towards the real life project concepts.

Along with the above, solve ML related problems 
in Kaggle\Hackerrank. some ML related problems are Titanic dataset and so on. Follow the tutorial posts of Kaggle.

Then ask a professor\lecturer like NBM sir,, MLE sir 
and tell them what do you know already after completing 
those courses and projects. 
They will provide you a project, then do it carefully 
and sincerely.

just a bit of advice - for CNN, sometimes you will 
need to code to process image as not all the solutions 
available in github.

The point is that most of don't follow the above way. 
but in my opinion the above way is really helpful 
but whatever you do make a concrete plan, 
ask your expert friend or senior to give you some 
advice on how to improve this problem. 
Don't ask them to change your plan cause you might not 
cope up with their plans. So make your plan in your way 
but it should cover almost all the topics stated above. 
Hopefully, you will get a solution.
